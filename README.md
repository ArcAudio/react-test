test with mashing different bits of tech together

If you're reading this you're probably wondering how I made this. 

By now I've probably largely forgotten. 

But I basically just smashed some tutorials together:

p5.js + react = https://markdenardo.medium.com/p5-js-in-react-723521717b93

truffle + web3 + metamsk = https://github.com/dappuniversity/starter_kit (Good yt channel, latter stuff is needless waffle, but a few years ago he had a bit more focus, he's scatty as fuck though)
